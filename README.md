The Doctor Seamless Appointment Booking System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the interaction between patients and doctors. The platform enables patients to register, search for specialists, upload necessary documents, and book appointments efficiently. Doctors can view appointment requests, review uploaded documents, and manage approvalsâ€”all in one centralized dashboard. Built using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, the system emphasizes role-based access, secure data handling, and real-time appointment tracking. This project eliminates the inefficiencies of traditional appointment systems by offering a modern, digital-first solution.
